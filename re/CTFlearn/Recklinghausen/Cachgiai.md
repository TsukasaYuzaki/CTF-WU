# Recklinghausen 

This is the 4th in a series of Beginner Reversing Challenges. If you are new to Reversing, you may want to solve Reykjavik, then Riyadh then Rangoon before solving this challenge. This is a 20 point challenge and is different in two ways from the previous 10 point challenges. Once you get into gdb, b *main+offset is your friend! Good Luck!

Once you solve the challenge you can use the flag to decrypt the souces.zip.enc file provided, if you are interested in seeing the source programs used to create the challenge.

The readme file includes some online resources if you are new to Reversing and Assembler.
